# Fractal Geometry
This repository contains Python scripts and a Jupyter Notebook, "Fractales_Estocásticos.ipynb," for exploring the secrets of geometry and fractals. It aims to provide an introduction to fractal geometry using various Python scripts.

# Contents
The repository consists of the following files:

Fractales_Estocásticos.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main file for exploring stochastic fractals. It contains code examples, explanations, and visualizations to understand the concepts of fractal geometry.

arbol_pitagoras.py: This Python script implements the Pythagoras tree fractal, which generates a tree-like structure based on the Pythagorean theorem.

copo_nieve.py: This Python script generates a snowflake fractal known as the Koch snowflake. The Koch snowflake is a recursive geometric figure that exhibits self-similarity.

curva_hilbert.py: This Python script generates the Hilbert curve fractal, a space-filling curve that traverses every point in a square, creating intricate patterns.

trinagulo_sierpinski.py: This Python script creates the Sierpinski triangle fractal, a fractal pattern formed by recursively dividing triangles into smaller triangles.

Los secretos de la geometría.pdf: This PDF file contains additional information, insights, and examples related to the secrets of geometry and fractals.

# Getting Started
To explore the fractals and geometry in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the command: git clone <repository-url>

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.


Open the Fractales_Estocásticos.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Follow the instructions and run the code cells in the notebook to explore the different fractals and understand the principles of fractal geometry.

Feel free to experiment with the code, modify parameters, and observe the changes in the generated fractals.
